# OPERA
This software tool implements the OPERA (Omics PlEiotRopic Association) method to test for combinatorial pleiotropic associations of molecular phenotypes (e.g., expression level of a gene and DNA methylation level at CpG sites) with a complex trait of interest using summary-level data from GWAS and molecular QTL studies. OPERA is a Bayesian generalization of the SMR &amp; HEIDI approach to a multi-omics model, where the molecular phenotypes are considered as exposures and only the complex trait is considered as the outcome. This tool can therefore be used to prioritize molecular phenotypes that mediate the genetic effects for complex trait and further provide mechanistic interpretation of the GWAS signal.

## Installation
To install OPERA, you can download the [opera_Linux.zip](https://github.com/wuyangf7/OPERA/blob/main/opera_Linux.zip) package, which contains a standalone (i.e., statically linked) 64-bit Linux executable file opera_Linux. We strongly recommend using this static executable because it is well-optimized and no further installation is required.

For compiling yourself, you should clone this repository and use the MAKEFILE,  
```
git clone https://github.com/wuyangf7/OPERA
cd OPERA
make
```
There are dependencies on your local MKL, BOOST and EIGEN Libraries.

# Tutorial
Our OPERA analysis consists of three steps. OPERA first estimates the global frequencies of each possible association patterns, then computes the posterior probability supporting each configuration by weighting the data likelihood with the estimated global frequencies. We compute the posterior probability of associations (PPA) for any combinatorial sites by summing up the posterior probability of configurations where the site combination present. For results passed the association test with a PPA threshold, OPERA performs the heterogeneity test to reject the associations that are due to linkage. 

We collected and prepared multiple public available molecular QTL data for users to perform the OPERA analysis with their specific complex trait of interest, which is available for download [here](https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/#DataResource). For illustration purpose, we also provide the demonstration [data](https://github.com/wuyangf7/OPERA/tree/main/demo) to run opera analysis with command line below. 

## Run OPERA for stage 1 analysis
> opera --besd-flist mylist --gwas-summary mygwas.ma --bfile mydata --estimate-pi --out myopera --thread-num 3

* --besd-flist reads a file to get the full paths of the multiple xQTL BESD files. The input format follows that for the SMR analysis (https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/#DataManagement). 
* --gwas-summary reads summary-level data from GWAS. The input format follows that for GCTA-COJO analysis (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#COJO).
* --bfile reads individual-level SNP genotype data (in PLINK binary format) from a reference sample for LD estimation, i.e. .bed, .bim, and .fam files.
* --out saves the estimation of prior proportions from the OPERA stage 1 analysis in .pi file (text format, see below example).

## Other parameters for stage 1 analysis
> opera --besd-flist mylist --gwas-summary mygwas.ma --bfile mydata --estimate-pi --prior-sigma 0.02,0.02 --pi-wind 100 --out myopera --thread-num 3 

* â€“-prior-sigma specifies the estimated variance of the non-zero mediated effects for each molecular trait on the complex trait.  It can be computed by the variance of the estimated SMR effects at the nominal significance level (i.e., 0.05) adjusting for the estimation errors, e.g., 0.02 (default).  
* --pi-wind defines a window centered on the molecular phenotype with smallest number of sites to select no overlap independent loci, e.g., 100 (default). 

## Run OPERA for stage 2 analysis and heterogeneity analysis
> opera --besd-flist mylist --gwas-summary mygwas.ma --bfile mydata --prior-pi 0.8,0.09,0.09,0.02 --out myopera --thread-num 3

* --prior-pi the estimated global proportions of each configuration from the stage 1 analysis. 
* --out saves the PPA and multi-exposure HEIDI test P-values for each possible association hypotheses in .ppa file (text format, see below example), and saves the results from the pairwise SMR analysis in .smr file
